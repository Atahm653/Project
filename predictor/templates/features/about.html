    <p>
        The Heart Disease Prediction System uses machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of heart disease based on key factors such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and more. It aims to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing heart conditions early and efficiently, improving patient outcomes, especially in regions with limited access to healthcare.
